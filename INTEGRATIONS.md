# Chatbot Integration System

This document outlines the chatbot integration system that allows connecting the AI chatbot to multiple platforms.

## Supported Platforms

The following platforms are supported:

1. **WordPress** - Embed the chatbot in WordPress websites
2. **WhatsApp** - Connect to WhatsApp Business API
3. **Instagram** - Connect to Instagram messaging
4. **Messenger** - Connect to Facebook Messenger
5. **Telegram** - Deploy as a Telegram bot
6. **Discord** - Add to Discord servers

## Integration Architecture

The integration system consists of:

1. **Frontend Components**:
   - `IntegrationForm` - Renders platform-specific credential forms
   - `IntegrationCard` - Displays integration options with connection status

2. **API Routes**:
   - `/api/integrations` - CRUD operations for managing user integration credentials
   - `/api/integrations/[platform]/webhook` - Webhook endpoints for receiving messages

3. **Hooks**:
   - `useIntegrations` - React hook for managing integration state and API interactions

## Adding a New Platform

To add a new platform:

1. Add the platform metadata to the `useIntegrations` hook
2. Create appropriate webhook endpoints in `/app/api/integrations/[platform]/webhook`
3. Update the `IntegrationForm` component to handle the platform-specific fields

## Integration Flow

1. Users select a platform to integrate with their chatbot
2. The system guides them to obtain necessary API credentials
3. Credentials are securely stored in the database
4. The system generates webhook URLs for the platform to send messages to
5. Messages received via webhooks are processed by the chatbot

## Webhook URLs

Each platform has a unique webhook URL:

- WhatsApp: `/api/integrations/whatsapp/webhook`
- Instagram: `/api/integrations/instagram/webhook`
- Messenger: `/api/integrations/messenger/webhook`
- Telegram: `/api/integrations/telegram/webhook`
- Discord: `/api/integrations/discord/webhook`
- WordPress: Uses an embed code that communicates with the chatbot API

## Security Considerations

- All API credentials are stored securely and never exposed to the client
- Webhook endpoints validate incoming requests using platform-specific methods
- Rate limiting should be implemented to prevent abuse

## Testing Integrations

Each integration can be tested by:

1. Setting up the integration with valid credentials
2. Using the platform's testing tools to send messages
3. Verifying the messages are received and processed by the chatbot

## Future Improvements

- Add OAuth flows for platforms that support it
- Implement more robust error handling and validation
- Add analytics for integration usage
- Support more messaging platforms
